The Grave
墓

Yesterday morning, while wandering about alone in a pine forest, I amused myself by piling up a small sandhill under an old pine tree.
昨朝我一人在松林里徘徊，在一株老松树下戏筑了一座砂丘。

"Let this be my own grave," said I.
我说，这便是我自己的坟墓了。

Picking up a piece of white stone, I scribbled my name on it and said, "Let this be my own gravestone."
我便拣了一块白石来写上了我自己的名字，把来做了墓碑。

On either side of the grave, I transplanted a pine sapling to keep it company.
我在墓的两旁还移种了两株稚松把它伴守。

This morning, recalling the grave, I went to pay a visit to it.
我今朝回想起来，又一人走来凭吊。

But the grave was nowhere to be found though I searched every nook and corner of the dense forest. Where was it gone to?
但我已经走遍了这莽莽的松原，我的坟墓究竟往那儿去了呢？

O ye remains of my yesterday's dead self, it was your own soul that had come to mourn at the grave! Where was my grave gone to?
啊，死了的我昨日的尸骸哟，哭墓的是你自己的灵魂，我的坟墓究竟往那儿去了呢？
