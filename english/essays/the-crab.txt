The Crab
螃蟹

An old crab grew restless. Finding himself stiff all over, he knew it was time for him to moult his shell.
老螃蟹觉得不安了，觉得全身太硬了，自己知道要蜕壳了。

He dashed here and there in search of a cave to hide. He was going to block up the mouth of the cave so that he could moult in secret.
他跑来跑去的寻。他想寻一个洞穴，躲了身子，将石子堵了穴口，隐隐的蜕壳。

He knew it would be very dangerous to shed his shell in the open because, with his new shell being soft, he might be eaten up by other crabs.
他知道外面蜕壳是危险的。身子还软，要被别的螃蟹吃掉的。

This fear was not groundless for he himself had really seen it happen to other moulting crabs.
这并非空害怕，他实在是亲眼见过。

The old crab kept moving about in a hurry.
他慌慌张张的走。
