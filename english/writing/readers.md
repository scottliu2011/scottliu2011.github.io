# 1. Spring

Spring has come, and everything is waking from its winter sleep. The fields are dressed in a fresh robe of green.

There are buds on the trees, and the wildflowers once more begin to peep forth. The white snowdrop is one of the first flowers of spring. How lovely it is!

Birds sing among the trees and begin to get ready for their nests for summer.

Men begin now to plow and to sow in the fields. The gardener digs the ground and sows seeds in the garden.

The days are warmer, for brighter sunshine has come again. Everything is full of life and joy.

Soon the soft spring showers will fall, to water the earth and make the seeds grow. It is the rain and the sunshine that makes the corn grow, and the trees bear leaves and flowers and fruit.
