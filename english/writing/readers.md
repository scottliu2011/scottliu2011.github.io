# 1. Spring

Spring has come, and everything is waking from its winter sleep. The fields are dressed in a fresh robe of green.

There are buds on the trees, and the wildflowers once more begin to peep forth. The white snowdrop is one of the first flowers of spring. How lovely it is!

Birds sing among the trees and begin to get ready for their nests for summer.

Men begin now to plow and to sow in the fields. The gardener digs the ground and sows seeds in the garden.

The days are warmer, for brighter sunshine has come again. Everything is full of life and joy.

Soon the soft spring showers will fall, to water the earth and make the seeds grow. It is the rain and the sunshine that makes the corn grow, and the trees bear leaves and flowers and fruit.

Nature does it all, it is the way, it gives us corn for bread, sweet herbs to eat, and pleasant fruit, that we may all be fed. Then let us never see a plant or blossom on a tree, but let us think how good it is, and ever thankful be.

# 2. Summer

Now it is summer. The days are long, and the sun is up in the sky hours before you are awake.

The trees are full of fruits, and the garden is gay with flowers.

The hay-makers are busy in the fields. Do you know what hay is? It is long grass cut down and dried. The men who cut it down are called the mowers. They cut it with long sharp scythes, or with reaping machines. And women and girls toss it about in the field, that the wind and the sun may dry it. How sweetly smells the new-mown hay!

When the hay is dry, it is made into a haystack. It is now ready to be used to feed horses and cows in winter, when there is no grass in the fields for them to eat.

This summer, I know, by the blue of the sky, by the trees' deeper green, as beneath them I lie. Now ring the sharp scythes of the mowers all day, and they spread to the air, the sweet-scented hay. Oh, summer, sweet summer, glide slowly away, for I love in your warmth and sunshine to play.

# 3. Autumn

Autumn has come. The green leaves are fading. Some have fallen from the trees, and are lying dead on the ground.

Now is the time for fruit. Apples, pears, plums, and all kinds of fruit are ripe.

The corn, too, is ripe. the reapers begin to cut it down. See how the tall stalks nod and wave in the sunshine! They bend under the weight of the golden grain.

How many loaves of bread will be made from that field of wheat! How many hungry mouths will be fed from it! When we eat our food, let us not forget to thank the people who causes the corn to grow.

The autumn winds are sighing, sighing in the trees. The ripened corn is waving, waving in the breeze. The harvest moon is shining, shining in the night. Over hill and valley, in floods of silver light.

The swallows come together, together from the eaves. Waiting for the falling, the falling of the leaves. They know the time is coming, the time when they must flee away to brighter sunshine, far, far across the sea.
