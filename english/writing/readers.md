# 1. Spring

Spring has come, and everything is waking from its winter sleep. The fields are dressed in a fresh robe of green.

There are buds on the trees, and the wildflowers once more begin to peep forth. The white snowdrop is one of the first flowers of spring. How lovely it is!

Birds sing among the trees and begin to get ready for their nests for summer.

Men begin now to plow and to sow in the fields. The gardener digs the ground and sows seeds in the garden.

The days are warmer, for brighter sunshine has come again. Everything is full of life and joy.

Soon the soft spring showers will fall, to water the earth and make the seeds grow. It is the rain and the sunshine that makes the corn grow, and the trees bear leaves and flowers and fruit.

# 2. Summer

Now it is summer. The days are long, and the sun is up in the sky hours before you are awake.

The trees are full of fruits, and the garden is gay with flowers.

The hay-makers are busy in the fields. Do you know what hay is? It is long grass cut down and dried. The men who cut it down are called the mowers. They cut it with long sharp scythes, or with reaping machines. And women and girls toss it about in the field, that the wind and the sun may dry it. How sweetly smells the new-mown hay!

When the hay is dry, it is made into a haystack. It is now ready to be used to feed horses and cows in winter, when there is no grass in the fields for them to eat.
