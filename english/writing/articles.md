# 1. What should governments build?

Subject:

Some people think governments should build more train and subway lines to reduce traffic congestion. Others think building more and wider roads is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Model:

Traffic congestion is frustrating and bothering many commuters in cities, with conflicting views on how to tackle this worrying trend. Some people claim that more train and subway lines should be constructed by the government. Others, however, believe that it is much better to widen the roads and build extra ones.

Providing more railway and underground lines tends to have a favorable influence on dealing with traffic jams. The key reason lies in the fact that compared with other modes of transport, a train has the capability to convey hundreds of passengers every time. Meanwhile, the track enables these vehicles to move smoothly without waiting for the traffic lights frequently. Thus the efficiency of the ground and underground railway system overwhelmingly dwarfs that of others, which ensures that travelers reach their destination on time. For these reasons, the advantages of the metro can attract a large number of car owners to abandon the use of their cars and choose to commute by train. In the long run, the possibility of traffic congestion can be reduced.

However, this does not automatically mean that simply investing in the railway system can tackle traffic congestion. After all, not all citizens can conveniently reach the railway station or just live beside it. Consequently, they may still choose to drive. In this case, there is still the need for the administration to build roads both in quantity and width. In the past, the construction of roads in many metropolises was not proportionate to the increase of private cars, which contributed to the outrageous congestion in the downtown areas. By contrast, when the advanced road system is available nowadays, cities can accommodate more cars and buses at the same time. Therefore it is less likely to see crowded roads.

In conclusion, simply building train and subway lines may not ultimately tackle traffic congestion. The government should not only invest in providing rail transport but also build more and wider roads.

# 2. Problems and measures for aging populations

Subject:

In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of aging populations.

Model:

It is true that people in industrialized nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.

As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an aging population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.

There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation, and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.

In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.

# 3. Should we only be concerned with our own communities and countries?

Subject:

We cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Model:

Some people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.

On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbors and fellow citizens. In most communities, there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritize local charity.

At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries, the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.

In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion, national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.
