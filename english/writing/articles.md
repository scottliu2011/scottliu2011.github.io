# 1. What should governments build?

Subject:

Some people think governments should build more train and subway lines to reduce traffic congestion. Others think building more and wider roads is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Model:

Traffic congestion is frustrating and bothering many commuters in cities, with conflicting views on how to tackle this worrying trend. Some people claim that more train and subway lines should be constructed by the government. Others, however, believe that it is much better to widen the roads and build extra ones.

Providing more railway and underground lines tends to have a favorable influence on dealing with traffic jams. The key reason lies in the fact that compared with other modes of transport, a train has the capability to convey hundreds of passengers every time. Meanwhile, the track enables these vehicles to move smoothly without waiting for the traffic lights frequently. Thus the efficiency of the ground and underground railway system overwhelmingly dwarfs that of others, which ensures that travelers reach their destination on time. For these reasons, the advantages of the metro can attract a large number of car owners to abandon the use of their cars and choose to commute by train. In the long run, the possibility of traffic congestion can be reduced.

However, this does not automatically mean that simply investing in the railway system can tackle traffic congestion. After all, not all citizens can conveniently reach the railway station or just live beside it. Consequently, they may still choose to drive. In this case, there is still the need for the administration to build roads both in quantity and width. In the past, the construction of roads in many metropolises was not proportionate to the increase of private cars, which contributed to the outrageous congestion in the downtown areas. By contrast, when the advanced road system is available nowadays, cities can accommodate more cars and buses at the same time. Therefore it is less likely to see crowded roads.

In conclusion, simply building train and subway lines may not ultimately tackle traffic congestion. The government should not only invest in providing rail transport but also build more and wider roads.

# 2. Problems and measures for aging populations

Subject:

In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of aging populations.

Model:

It is true that people in industrialized nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.

As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an aging population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.

There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation, and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.

In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.

# 3. Should we only be concerned with our own communities and countries?

Subject:

We cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Model:

Some people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.

On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbors and fellow citizens. In most communities, there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritize local charity.

At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries, the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.

In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion, national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.

# 4. Agree or disagree about talking to school students

Subject:

Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that they are the best people to talk to school students disagree about the danger of committing a crime. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Model:

The number of juvenile delinquents is rising at an alarming speed. Some people may claim that ex-prisoners who have become good citizens are the most desired people to talk about the clangers of crimes. However, I disagree with this opinion.

Admittedly, it is an effective method to invite reformed ex-prisoners to inform students of the frustrating outcomes of breaking the law. The key reason lies in the fact that serving a prison sentence is not a happy experience. When the youth are exposed to the stories of life in jail, they will be deterred and realize how unpleasant it is to be imprisoned. For example, the ones in prison have to be separated from their families and are at risk of being bullied by evil roommates. In this case, when the school attendants hear about this, they will be less likely to get involved in illegal activities. There will be a guarantee that their future can be on the right track.

However, this does not automatically mean that delivering a speech by the ex-prisoners can educate students and help them build up the correct value system. After all, the experience of meeting and learning from someone who has suffered in prison can be disturbing for some students, especially girls. They may be shocked, or horrified. In this case, there should also be some much softer ways to keep students away from offending the law. For example, the Ministry of Education can work with some animation companies to produce cartoons that spontaneously show the triumph of justice over the devil. From observing the happy ending of law-abiding ones, these innocents can be encouraged to stay away from violating the law.

As analyzed above, ex-prisoners may exert positive effects on preventing students from going astray. However, we should still invite other more reliable ones to conduct the education about laws and morality.

# 5. Reasons and solutions regarding interpersonal skills of graduate

Subject:

Many businesses think that the new employees who graduate from school lack basic interpersonal skills, such as working with colleagues as a team. What are the reasons and what are the solutions? Propose solutions and Present your ideas about a topic.

Model:

New employees who have just graduated from high schools or universities are always green hands in dealing with interpersonal relations. In my opinion, various reasons are contributing to this phenomenon, but some feasible measures can be adopted to tackle it.

One of the main reasons is that schools nowadays always focus on teaching academic subjects, while more practical, non-academic ones are considered to be less important and left out of the curriculum. Thus young people may be qualified in coping with difficulties and challenges in their studies, rather than in knowing how to behave in a team. Another crucial factor is that with the advent and popularity of smartphones, the youth are fascinated with the virtual world where fancy games induce them to stay lonely in a corner and stare at the screen. As a result, there is little interest in them joining in the real conversation both at school and home, which contributes to the lack of social skills, especially communication.

To address this problem, schools should provide more occasions to encourage students to interact with each other. For example, teachers can require learners to make a presentation in class and to accept the inquiry from their peers. Additionally, it should be noted that free time activities, such as playing sports can help the attendants learn about practical matters. In this case, school authorities should organize some relevant events to let students sociable. To further enhance the interaction ability, companies can require new employees not to take their mobile phones with them during the training process. What the newcomers should do is cooperate with other colleagues to figure out solutions to some cases. Those who fail to achieve this goal will be dismissed. Faced with tremendous pressure, graduates may quickly learn to build interpersonal ties.

As analyzed above, this issue seems to be complicated, but with effective approaches, we are confident to solve it strategically.
